Skills in numerical analysis are crucial for an undergraduate student in physics. Numerical analysis is used in computational physics - problems in physics that only a computer can solve. We seek to study selected algorithms and implement them in a Python program using a from-scratch approach. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to using NumPy and loops in implementing the algorithms. If we have a sufficient understanding of the algorithms, we will then use the corresponding SciPy packages to make our lives easier.
